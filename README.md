COP-3230
There are two ways to implement this task. 
The data we receive does not contain groupName but only groupId we can query all groups, find the group name by id, expand the member object, and significantly expand the textField component to implement this task.
The second way is to add to the TAS the ability to get a group object and simply add the ability to display textField as plain text.
Which of the methods will be more correct?
