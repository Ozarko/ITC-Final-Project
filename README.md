I fixed all the issues that were found during the testing, but during fixing, I found another issue. An incorrect display of the date on the Edit Member Profile page on the dependent tab. For dependent members, the effective date is the same as for the original member.
The relatedInstances field doesn't contain effective start / end date fields  but should have to solve this problem.
This issue was not listed in the bug list and wasn't applied to the AC of this task.
