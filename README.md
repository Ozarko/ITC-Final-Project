I fixed all the issues that were detected during testing, but in the process of change, I found another problem, incorrect display of the date on the Edit Member Profile page on the dependent tab, for dependent members - the effective date, as well as the original participant's effective date.
The relatedInstances field does not contain effective start / end date fields to correct this issue. 
This issue was not listed in the bug list and does not apply to the AC of this task.
