Hi, I replaced the groupEffectiveStartDate \ groupEffectiveEndDate fields with coverageStartDate \ coverageEndDate and in case if the member has no dependents then the coverageStartDate fields are equal to the effectiveStartDate field, but if the member has dependent members the values of these fields are different.
